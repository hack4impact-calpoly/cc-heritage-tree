## Overview
The Central Coast Heritage Tree Foundation focuses on the protection, preservation, and preventive healthcare for legacy and heritage oaks in the greater Templeton area. They help heritage oaks by utilizing preventive tree care, restoring soil, planting Templeton acorns, and educating the community through conversation and connection.

### Purpose

The goal is to build upon last yearâ€™s project by creating a user-friendly interface that allows volunteers to collect and enter tree inventory data directly into a digital system. This data will then be displayed on an interactive map, accessible to other volunteers with permissions, and available for public viewing on the website.

Additionally, the organization would like the application to feature an interactive map showcasing all heritage trees in the area. Users will be able to look up existing trees, explore their history, and use this information to make informed decisions about future planting locations.
